# pixoo-display

Manage the images to display on your Divoom Pixoo easily.
This version only works in 16x16, so if you have a solution for supporting other formats (such as the Max in 32x32), I'm up for it.

This project builds on the work of [virtualabs](https://github.com/virtualabs/pixoo-client), and uses the following projects to work:
 - [bluetooth-serial-port](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-bluetooth-serial-port)
 - [decode-gif](https://github.com/Richienb/decode-gif)
